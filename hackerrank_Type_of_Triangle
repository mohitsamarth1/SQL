DIFFICULTY: Easy
Type of Triangle
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
•    Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
•    Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
•    Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
•    Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Solution:
SELECT
CASE
when A+B>C then (
    CASE
    when A=B and B=C then 'Equilateral'
    when A=B or A=C or B=C then 'Isosceles'
    when A!=B or B!=C or A!=C then 'Scalene'
    END
)
ELSE 'Not A Triangle'
END
