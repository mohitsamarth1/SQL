New Companies
Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy: 
Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.
Note:
The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

Solution:
Select c.company_code,c.founder,
(select count(distinct(l.lead_manager_code)) from Lead_Manager l where c.company_code=l.company_code),
(select count(distinct(s.senior_manager_code)) from Senior_Manager s where c.company_code=s.company_code),
(select count(distinct(m.manager_code)) from Manager m where c.company_code=m.company_code),
(select count(distinct(e.employee_code)) from Employee e where c.company_code=e.company_code)
from Company c
order by c.company_code;
