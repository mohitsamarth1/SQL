Occupations

Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.
Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

Solution:
SET @d=0, @a=0, @p=0, @s=0;
SELECT MAX(Doctor),MAX(Professor),MAX(SINGER),MAX(Actor)
FROM
(SELECT IF(OCCUPATION='Actor',NAME,NULL) AS Actor,
        IF(OCCUPATION='Doctor',NAME,NULL) AS Doctor,
        IF(OCCUPATION='Professor',NAME,NULL) AS Professor,
        IF(OCCUPATION='Singer',NAME,NULL) AS SINGER,
 CASE OCCUPATION
    WHEN 'Actor' THEN @a:=@a+1
    WHEN 'Doctor' THEN @d:=@d+1
    WHEN 'Professor' THEN @p:=@p+1
    WHEN 'Singer' THEN @s:=@s+1
 END
AS idn FROM OCCUPATIONS ORDER BY NAME )
AS temp GROUP BY temp.idn;
